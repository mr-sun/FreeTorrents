FreeTorrents is a standalone application which fakes upload and download stats of a torrent to almost all bittorrent trackers.

FreeTorrents is a freeware software program that can boost your bittorrent upload ratio.
FreeTorrents can help you survive on trackers that enforce a minimum 1:1 trading ratio, and can keep you from getting banned for not uploading. So how does it work? In simple words, it modifies the conversation between your bittorrent client and the tracker, suppressing the actual upload amount. Instead, FreeTorrents puts you in control of your own upload ratio. You can define how much upload you want to submit to the tracker.
